# Name
Foodie

## Description
Foodie is a small app similar to Instagram with small differences. This app allows you to make text post such as phrases, paragraphs, or even short sentences. These text post are intertwined with the image post. This app is soley used to showcase new and invented restuarants or food trucks located in the user's city or surrounding areas. What shows up on the app will be different for each user depending on their current location. Anyone is able to post about there food experiences even individuals who are food gurus. 

Features: 
1. On the navagation the user can click on the profie icon and a drop-down menu will appear. The drop-down menu will showcase the post the user decides to save, the users profile, settings, and the user can logout. The drop-down features will soon lead to a seperate page. 
2. When hovering over a users profile image the image will enlarge as if it was clicked. This feature will later be clickable and lead to the users profile.
3. Under each image post there are two different icons; one for liking the image and one for commenting on the image. 
4. When the heart is hovered over the outline will turn red.
5. When the heart is clicked the heart will fill and turn red. 
6. When the comment icon is hovered the outline will turn a gold color.
7. Under each text post there is a thumbs up icon to like the text post and a comment bubble.
8. On the left side of the html file there is following section with different places a person can follow
9. When hovering over the follow button it will turn purple.
10. At the end of the follow section there is a button that will redirect the user to the top of the following list. 
11. On the left side there is a current location the user is able to click
12. A pop block will appear once the button is click which will allow the user to decide if they want to share there location
13. Once the user clicks yes on the pop up there current location will appear on the page 


## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Installation
1. The programming language: Javascript
2. The operating system: Microsoft Windows, Apple IOS, Google Andriod OS
 
## Support
For help you can use the website called https://w3schools.com for help. This website details how to solve a lot of coding issues. 

## Roadmap
For the future I wanted to add more features to this web app. I want to have a counter function which will be for the heart button. Once the heart is clicked it will change the number beside it displaying the number of likes on a post. I also want the current location feature to change the user's feed depending on their location. I want the user to be able to save certain placces that they like. 

## Contributing
I am open to any and all contributions that will help make my web page more unqiue and functionable. 
Requirements: 
1. User friendly. I want to keep the web app easy for the user to use.
2. Creative takes which means ideas that will stand out.
3. Explanation on what the code they are suggesting does and why it wil be useful.

Instructions: 
1. Please pay attention to all the comments. 
2. If you add code please write a comment so the next person will understand the changes made. 
3. The code starts of with the nav, then the following list column located on the left side, then the image posts and write post. 
4. Make the name of your divs, ids, and or functions unique and understandable. I prefer divs to say what exactly they are used for. For example, you will see divs such as heartclick or follow. These tells the next person exactly what they are for.

## Project status

There are some issues I was not able to solve just yet on the project. For example, figuring out a more effect and less repetitive code. I realize I had to use the same code multiple times with different names when I know there is a easier way. However, I am unsure at this time what the easier way is. Also im still trying to figure out how to add a counter from when the heart is click. I want the number to change once the heart is click and or unclicked.
